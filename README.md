# Hello, I'm FlintSH
*serial server owner and developer since 2012*

I can code in Python, Java, and C#, among others too (who cares)

I've run more game servers than you could count. I couldn't even begin to do it.

If you ever need to reach out I am always available via me@fl1nt.dev (I check often)

I also host a portfolio and blog which can be found @ https://fl1nt.dev/
