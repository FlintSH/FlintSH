# Hi, I'm FlintSH ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer from Pittsburgh, PA. I used to run game servers and did for over 10 years. I've been programming just as long.

My current passion is AI, and I'm working on a browser extension that I hope will change the way we digest information on the web. It's available now and you can learn more [here](https://avora.one).

After Avora, I want double down and work on even more AI projects. I'm also interested in research and development of future AI models.

## Projects

- [fl1nt.dev](https://fl1nt.dev): My website - do check it out.
- [Avora](https://avora.one): An AI-powered browser extension, it can make your life easier.
- [Outlier Tools](https://outlier.tools): A collection of free open-source tools to help Outlier freelancers, entirely handled in-browser.
- [find.fl1nt.dev](https://find.fl1nt.dev): Finds all websites under a keyword. I made it because google sucks at finding niche sites.
- [NebulaMC](https://discord.gg/3BjbDwPBDx): Now shut down, but was my custom-coded Minecraft server - ran with [@sp-ec](https://github.com/sp-ec).

Various other countless game servers and projects that I've worked on over the years.
