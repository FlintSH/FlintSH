# Hi, I'm FlintSH ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught programmer from Pittsburgh, PA. I used to run game servers and did for over 10 years as a kid. I've been programming just as long. I love building, there's nothing more therapudic or rewarding to me.

My current passion is AI, and I'm working at Scale AI to improve its AI training platform. Prior to Scale, I worked on AI projects like Avora and Disclone!

In the longterm, I want to double down and work on even more AI projects. I'm also interested in research and development of future AI models.

## Things I've made:

- [fl1nt.dev](https://fl1nt.dev): My website - do check it out. Entirely written from scratch.
- [Flare](https://github.com/FlintSH/Flare): A modern, lightning fast file sharing platform with support for ShareX and Flameshot.
- [Avora](https://avora.one): A browser extension that uses embeddings and a large language model to analyze your web content and answer questions.
- [Outlier Tools](https://outlier.tools): A collection of free open-source tools to help Outlier workers understand their earnings.
- [find.fl1nt.dev](https://find.fl1nt.dev): Finds all websites under a keyword. I made it because google sucks at finding niche sites.
- [NebulaMC](https://discord.gg/3BjbDwPBDx): Now shut down, but was my custom-coded Minecraft server - ran with [@sp-ec](https://github.com/sp-ec).

Various other countless game servers and projects that I've worked on over the years.
