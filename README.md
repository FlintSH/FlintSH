# Hi, I'm FlintSH ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught programmer from Pittsburgh, PA. I used to run game servers and did for over 10 years as a kid. I've been programming just as long. I love building, there's nothing more therapudic or rewarding to me.

My current passion is AI, and I'm working at Scale AI to improve its AI training platform. Prior to Scale, I worked on AI projects like Avora and Disclone (see below).

Long-term, I want to work on even more AI projects. I'm also interested in research and development of future AI models.

## Things I've made:

- [fl1nt.dev](https://fl1nt.dev): My website - do check it out. Entirely written from scratch.
- [Flare](https://github.com/FlintSH/Flare): A modern, lightning fast file sharing platform with support for ShareX and Flameshot.
- [Avora](https://avora.one): A browser extension that uses embeddings and a LLM to analyze web content and answer questions.
- [Outlier Tools](https://outlier.tools): A collection of free open-source tools to help Outlier workers understand their earnings.
- [Disclone](https://github.com/FlintSH/Disclone): A python script that converts Discord chatlogs to OpenAI compatible fine-tuning datasets.
- [legcord.app](https://legcord.app): Built with Astro, I created the website for the popular alternative Discord client Legcord.
- [website-finder](https://github.com/FlintSH/website-finder): Finds all websites under a keyword. I made it because google sucks at finding niche sites.

There's a lot of other things I've made over the years, but these are the most prevalent. :)
