# Hi, I'm FlintSH ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer and game server enthusiast from Pittsburgh, PA. I've been running game servers for over 10 years and programming just as long.

My current passion is AI, and I'm working on a browser extension that I hope will change the way we digest information on the web. It is coming soon, and you can learn more [here](https://avora.one).

After Avora, I want double down and work on even more AI projects. I'm also interested in research and development of future AI models.

## Projects

- [fl1nt.dev](https://fl1nt.dev): My website - do check it out.
- [Avora](https://avora.one): An AI-powered browser extension that I'm working on.
- [NebulaMC](https://discord.gg/3BjbDwPBDx): Now shut down, but was my custom-coded Minecraft server - ran with [@sp-ec](https://github.com/sp-ec).

Various other countless game servers and projects that I've worked on over the years.
